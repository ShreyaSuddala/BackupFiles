Agile development methodology

There are many different forms of the agile development method, including scrum, crystal, extreme programming (XP), and feature-driven development (FDD).
 Pros: The primary benefit of agile software development is that it allows software to be released in iterations

Jira is a project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and release software. 
It can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
Software development: Planning and launching campaigns
Marketing: Managing and tracking requests
IT: Building creative workflows
Design: Creating custom processes
Operations: Planning and organizing tasks 


Jira's features include: 
Agile project management: Supports agile methodologies like scrum and kanban 
Resource management: Helps with organization, coordination, and visibility across a team's workload 
Real-time tracking and reporting: Helps manage large, complex projects 
Integrations: Integrates with third-party apps like Slack, Figma, and GitHub 
Test case management: Includes automated and manual test case management fields 

===================================================================================

Scrum is a framework for agile project management that helps teams work together to achieve a common goal. 
It's often used in software development, but its principles can be applied to many types of teamwork. 
Here are some key aspects of Scrum:

==Sprints==

Teams break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations called sprints.
 Sprints are typically one to four weeks long. 

==Self-organization==

Scrum encourages teams to learn from experience, self-organize, and adapt to change. 

==Roles==

Scrum describes a set of roles, including the Scrum Master, who facilitates the process and acts as a servant leader, coach, mentor, and more. 

==Feedback==

Teams and the business use feedback from each sprint to determine what to build next. 

==Visibility==

Scrum provides daily visibility into the state of a project, which can help stakeholders plan and adjust their strategies

A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that help software development teams streamline the process of creating, testing, and deploying applications. 
CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment

The phases of a CI/CD pipeline are:
Build: Create and compile code
Test: Test the code
Deliver: Send an approved codebase to a production environment
Deploy: Deploy the changes and move the final product into production 
Some challenges that teams may face when adopting CI/CD include manual steps in the release process, downtime risk, and inefficient resource utilization
